# **Fine-tuning for Image Classification with ðŸ¤— Transformers**

This notebook shows how to fine-tune any pretrained Vision model for Image Classification on a custom dataset. The idea is to add a randomly initialized classification head on top of a pre-trained encoder, and fine-tune the model altogether on a labeled dataset.

## ImageFolder

This notebook leverages the [ImageFolder](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/image_process#imagefolder) feature to easily run the notebook on a custom dataset (namely, [EuroSAT](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) in this tutorial). You can either load a `Dataset` from local folders or from local/remote files, like zip or tar.

## Any model

This notebook is built to run on any image classification dataset with any vision model checkpoint from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/) as long as that model has a version with a Image Classification head, such as:
* [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit#transformers.ViTForImageClassification)
* [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/swin#transformers.SwinForImageClassification)
* [ConvNeXT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/convnext#transformers.ConvNextForImageClassification)

- in short, any model supported by [AutoModelForImageClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForImageClassification).

## Data augmentation

This notebook leverages Torchvision's [transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) for applying data augmentation - note that we do provide alternative notebooks which leverage other libraries, including:

* [Albumentations](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification_albumentations.ipynb)
* [Kornia](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification_kornia.ipynb)
* [imgaug](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification_imgaug.ipynb). 

---

Depending on the model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors. Set those two parameters, then the rest of the notebook should run smoothly.

In this notebook, we'll fine-tune from the https://huggingface.co/microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224 checkpoint, but note that there are many, many more available on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=vision).

In this notebook, we will see how to fine-tune one of the [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) vision models on an Image Classification dataset.

Given an image, the goal is to predict an appropriate class for it, like "tiger". The screenshot below is taken from a [ViT fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224) - try out the inference widget!

### Loading the dataset

We will use the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library's [ImageFolder](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/image_process#imagefolder) feature to download our custom dataset into a DatasetDict.

In this case, the EuroSAT dataset is hosted remotely, so we provide the `data_files` argument. Alternatively, if you have local folders with images, you can load them using the `data_dir` argument.
"""

from datasets import load_dataset 

# load a custom dataset from local/remote files or folders using the ImageFolder feature

# option 1: local/remote files (supporting the following formats: tar, gzip, zip, xz, rar, zstd)
dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_files="https://madm.dfki.de/files/sentinel/EuroSAT.zip")

# note that you can also provide several splits:
# dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_files={"train": ["path/to/file1", "path/to/file2"], "test": ["path/to/file3", "path/to/file4"]})

# note that you can push your dataset to the hub very easily (and reload afterwards using load_dataset)!
# dataset.push_to_hub("nielsr/eurosat")
# dataset.push_to_hub("nielsr/eurosat", private=True)

# option 2: local folder
# dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="path_to_folder")

# option 3: just load any existing dataset from the hub, like CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST ...
# dataset = load_dataset("cifar10")

"""The cool thing is that we can directly view the image (as the 'image' field is an [Image feature](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html#datasets.Image)), as follows:"""

example['image']

"""Let's make it a little bigger as the images in the EuroSAT dataset are of low resolution (64x64 pixels):"""

example['image'].resize((200, 200))

example['label']

"""As you can see, the `label` field is not an actual string label. By default the `ClassLabel` fields are encoded into integers for convenience:"""

    label2id[label] = i
    id2label[i] = label

id2label[2]

"""### Preprocessing the data

Before we can feed these images to our model, we need to preprocess them. 

Preprocessing images typically comes down to (1) resizing them to a particular size (2) normalizing the color channels (R,G,B) using a mean and standard deviation. These are referred to as **image transformations**.

In addition, one typically performs what is called **data augmentation** during training (like random cropping and flipping) to make the model more robust and achieve higher accuracy. Data augmentation is also a great technique to increase the size of the training data.

We will use `torchvision.transforms` for the image transformations/data augmentation in this tutorial, but note that one can use any other package (like [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/), [imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug), [Kornia](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) etc.).

To make sure we (1) resize to the appropriate size (2) use the appropriate image mean and standard deviation for the model architecture we are going to use, we instantiate what is called a feature extractor with the `AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained` method.

This feature extractor is a minimal preprocessor that can be used to prepare images for inference.

"""### Training the model

Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. For classification we use the `AutoModelForImageClassification` class. Calling the `from_pretrained` method on it will download and cache the weights for us. As the label ids and the number of labels are dataset dependent, we pass `label2id`, and `id2label` alongside the `model_checkpoint` here. This will make sure a custom classification head will be created (with a custom number of output neurons).

NOTE: in case you're planning to fine-tune an already fine-tuned checkpoint, like [facebook/convnext-tiny-224](https://huggingface.co/facebook/convnext-tiny-224) (which has already been fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k), then you need to provide the additional argument `ignore_mismatched_sizes=True` to the `from_pretrained` method. This will make sure the output head (with 1000 output neurons) is thrown away and replaced by a new, randomly initialized classification head that includes a custom number of output neurons. You don't need to specify this argument in case the pre-trained model doesn't include a head.
"""

)

"""The warning is telling us we are throwing away some weights (the weights and bias of the `classifier` layer) and randomly initializing some other (the weights and bias of a new `classifier` layer). This is expected in this case, because we are adding a new head for which we don't have pretrained weights, so the library warns us we should fine-tune this model before using it for inference, which is exactly what we are going to do.

To instantiate a `Trainer`, we will need to define the training configuration and the evaluation metric. The most important is the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model.

Most of the training arguments are pretty self-explanatory, but one that is quite important here is `remove_unused_columns=False`. This one will drop any features not used by the model's call function. By default it's `True` because usually it's ideal to drop unused feature columns, making it easier to unpack inputs into the model's call function. But, in our case, we need the unused features ('image' in particular) in order to create 'pixel_values'.

Since the best model might not be the one at the end of training, we ask the `Trainer` to load the best model it saved (according to `metric_name`) at the end of training.

The last argument `push_to_hub` allows the Trainer to push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally with a name that is different from the name of the repository, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"nielsr/vit-finetuned-cifar10"` or `"huggingface/nielsr/vit-finetuned-cifar10"`).

Next, we need to define a function for how to compute the metrics from the predictions, which will just use the `metric` we loaded earlier. The only preprocessing we have to do is to take the argmax of our predicted logits:
